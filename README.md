# MetroBuddy

![Build status](https://github.com/alexaubry/metrobuddy/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

MetroBuddy is an iOS app that allows you to track the balance of your transit card, with a primary focus on New York's MetroCard. As a New Yorker (even though 2020 is not exactly the year of subway-riding), seeing this message is rather frustrating...

I built MetroBuddy to alleviate this pain, and improve my SwiftUI and app architecting skills. The app is available for free on the App Store.

## Core Principles

- The app must not get in the way of the user's commute
    - No onboarding/account required
    - No cellular connection required
    - Fast and straightforward interactions
- Turnstiles aren't always accessible, so the app must be
    - Property tag views for accessibility 
    - Design with Dynamic Type and color contrast in mind
    - Keep design simple

## Interface Design

These are the main screens of the app:

| Onboarding | Idle State | Expiration Date Picker |
|---|---|---|
| ![Onboarding](.github/onboarding.png) | ![Idle](.github/idle.png) | ![Insufficient fare](.github/expiration.png) |

### Information Structure
The information is structured in a way that satisfies both of the core principles: obvious and accessible. The linear data layout works well with screen readers. The use of a larger font for the balance makes it easier for riders to know if they need to reload their MetroCard before swiping while they are running down the station's stairs.

### Metaphors
As a public transit enthusiast, swiping my MetroCard to enter the subway brings me joy. I wanted to replicate this enthusiasm in the app by making it playful and "obviously metro". 
- The card's balance is displayed inside a view that resembles a MetroCard
- You can swipe the card to the left to record one swipe
- When the balance is insufficient to record a swipe, a toast with a monospaced font appears to display the same message as the turnstile

### Colors
Since the app will most likely be used just before or right after the user enters the subway, a dark design felt like a natural decision to better accomodates the subway's minimally lit environment.

## Architecture Overview

- The `MetroKit` framework contains the core building blocks of the app:
    - The app's Core Data models
    - The `MetroCardDataStore` protocol that exposes Combine publishers for getting and updating the card
    - The `UserPreferences` protocol that provides a type-safe wrapper around UserDefaults
    - Helpers to load and configure persistent containers
- The main `App` target
    - Uses the `MVVM` pattern: 
        - `ObservableObject` view models get the data from `MetroKit`, compute the contents of the view and publish them
        - SwiftUI views subscribe to their view model through `EnvironmentObject` and forwards them the user's input 
    - Organized by screens (root/error/main) which each have their own components
    - Defines shared components to be reused by multiple views and helpers
    
The app's Core Data setup is heavily inspired by [CareKit's](https://github.com/carekit-apple/CareKit) approach. Consumers of the data makes requests and submits updates through a single store, which returns static snapshots in the form of a `struct` based on the data of the managed object.

To facilitate accessing the data of this snapshot, we wrap it inside an `ObjectReference` object, which contains the managed object's identifier that can only be used internally by `MetroKit` without being exposed to consumers of the store. Members of the snapshot are accessible directly from the
object reference, through a dynamic member lookup subscript. For example, these two calls are equivalent:

```swift
let card: ObjectReference<MetroCard> = ... // get the card from the store
card.snapshot.balance == card.balance // true
```

## Tests

This is the overview of the state of testing:
- `MetroKit` stores and models are unit-tested
- The app's core flows are UI-tested
- [ ] The app's view models should be unit-tested
- [ ] The app should be tested and deployed continously

To facilitate unit-testing, the project contains a `MetroTesting` framework, that defines mocks for the data store and preferences. To configure UI tests, we define *scenarios*, which are types that have a method that creates a mock. Scenarios are usually scoped to a single use case, e.g. the "new install" scenario or "returning user" scenario. The UI tests can pass the name of the scenario class to the `XCUIApplication`'s launch arguments. The app will attempt to parse the scenario's class name and get the mock store from it. The `MetroTesting` framework and this injection logic are only enabled on debug builds. The framework is not included in the release build.

UI tests also use the *page-object* pattern, which is a way to decouple the automation logic from test assertions. The app's screens are organized into *pages* that use `XCUIApplication` to get properties from elements and interact with them.

To record screenshots for the App Store, we use [snapshot](http://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/screenshots/) from fastlane.
