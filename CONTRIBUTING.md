## Getting started

If you have feedback or suggestions, please open an issue to discuss it. PRs are welcome for bug fixes or improvements. To make a PR:

- Fork the repo
- Create your branch and make your changes
- Run all the unit tests and make sure they all pass
- Create a PR pointing to the `main` branch of this repo
- Address or discuss any feedback

When CI passes and the PR is approved, a maintainer will merge the PR.
